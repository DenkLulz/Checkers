a board is needed, chips must be spreaded over the board

- Machine's Logic (Priority System)
	� If there's a kill, select whatever chip and move it
	� If there's 

- Get available options mechanism:

foreach xDir in xDirs
	if nextCell.chip == null
		option.cell = nextCell
		continue
	else 
		if nextCell.chip.team != currentCell.chip.team
			nextCell = findCell (nextCell.position + {x: xDir, y: yDir})
			if (nextCell.chip == null)
				option.kills.push (nextCell)
				do
					nextCellOptions = getMoves (nextCell)
					if (nextCellOptions.length == 0)
						break
					options = ...nextCellOptions
				
					
ISSUES:
- AI Priority Decision System is not complete
- Promoted Chips Logic isn't implemented yet
- Winning & Losing Logic isn't implemented yet
- Consecutive Killing Logic
